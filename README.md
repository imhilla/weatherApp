> This is a Microverse Javascript Project

> Todolist!

## Description

To do list is an app that enables user to track down, organize and implement tasks and projects. It is similar to <a href="https://en.todoist.com/">Todolist</a>. 

The project was built using webpack to bundle javascript files into single file, the main js file. Files in the source folder represent individual module that symbolize a particular functionality. The ‘todos’ are objects that are dynamically created, and we used factory functions and constructors to generate them.
